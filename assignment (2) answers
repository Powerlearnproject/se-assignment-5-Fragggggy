Debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful feature that allows developers to find and fix issues in their code efficiently. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up and starting debugging for a simple program in VS Code, along with key debugging features available:

Setting Up and Starting Debugging
1. Install Necessary Tools
Ensure you have the necessary debuggers and language support extensions installed for the programming language you are using (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
2. Open Your Project in VS Code
Open VS Code and navigate to File -> Open Folder... to open your project folder.
3. Create a Launch Configuration
VS Code uses launch configurations to specify how to start and debug your program. Typically, you configure this in a launch.json file.
Open the Debug View:

Click on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side (Ctrl+Shift+D) or go to Run -> Start Debugging.
Configure a Launch Configuration:

If you don't have a launch.json file, VS Code will prompt you to create one.
Choose the environment (e.g., Node.js, Python) for your program.
Edit launch.json:

You can manually edit launch.json to configure specific options like program path, arguments, environment variables, etc.
4. Set Breakpoints
Place breakpoints in your code where you want the debugger to pause execution for inspection.
Click in the Gutter:
Click in the gutter area (next to line numbers) in the editor to set a breakpoint.
Alternatively, use F9 to toggle breakpoints.
5. Start Debugging
Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click the green play button in the Debug toolbar to start debugging.
VS Code will launch your program in debugging mode and pause at the first breakpoint it encounters.
6. Debugging Controls
Debug Toolbar:

Use the toolbar at the top of the editor to control debugging:
Step Over (F10): Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line.
Step Into (F11): Moves into a function call.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Moves out of the current function.
Continue (F5): Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint or end.
Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5): Stops and restarts the debugging session.
Variables and Watches:

View and inspect the values of variables in the Debug sidebar.
Add expressions to watch by clicking + in the VARIABLES section of the Debug sidebar.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls leading to the current execution point.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when specified conditions are met.
Inline Debugging: Debug JavaScript and TypeScript directly in the editor without needing an external browser or tool.
Multi-Session Debugging: Run multiple debugging sessions simultaneously, helpful for debugging client-server applications.
Remote Debugging: Debug applications running on remote machines or devices.
Debugging Extensions: Extensions like Debugger for Chrome, Python, Java, etc., provide additional debugging capabilities tailored to specific languages and frameworks.
Summary
Debugging in VS Code provides developers with powerful tools to identify and resolve issues in their code efficiently. By setting up launch configurations, placing breakpoints, and using debugging controls effectively, developers can streamline the debugging process and improve the quality of their applications.

Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (Ctrl+Shift+G).
Initialize Repository:

Click on the Initialize Repository button (Initialize Git repository in this workspace) or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Git: Initialize Repository.
Select Repository Location:

Choose the folder where you want to initialize the Git repository. Click Initialize.
3. Stage and Commit Changes
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, youâ€™ll see a list of changed files. Click on the + icon next to each file you want to stage (prepare for commit).
Commit Changes:

Enter a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control view.
Click the check mark (Commit) to commit the changes.
4. Push Changes to GitHub
Linking to GitHub:

If not already linked, set up a remote repository on GitHub:
Go to GitHub and create a new repository (without initializing with a README, since you already have a local repository).
Copy the URL of your GitHub repository.
Add Remote:

Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Git: Add Remote.
Paste the GitHub repository URL as the remote URL and provide a name for your remote (typically origin).
Push Changes:

After committing your changes locally, click on the ... (more actions) button in the Source Control view header and select Push.
Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Git: Push.
Enter GitHub Credentials:

If prompted, enter your GitHub credentials (username and password/token).
Confirm Push:

Confirm the push operation to send your committed changes to GitHub.
Additional Git Operations in VS Code
Pulling Changes: Use Git: Pull from the Command Palette to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
Viewing History: Click on the clock icon in the Source Control view to see commit history.
Branch Management: Create, switch, and merge branches using the Source Control view or Command Palette.
Summary
Integrating Git with VS Code allows you to manage version control seamlessly from within your coding environment. By initializing repositories, staging changes, making commits, and pushing to GitHub, you can effectively track and collaborate on your codebase. VS Codeâ€™s integration with Git simplifies these processes and enhances productivity for developers working with version control.
